# Python-Design-Patterns-Webinar
This repo contains the code and the slides that I used during my python design patterns webinar with Lux Academy. The slides are html files that I created using the Sphinx documentation tool. The code is divided into different versions as we refactor the bad design to a good design. It is written in jupyter notebooks.
